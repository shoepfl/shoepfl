The Systems Biology community was among the first scientific communities to recognize the need for reproducible models. Still, many published models are not reproducible. Tiwari et al. currently classified 328 published models by their reproducibility. They found out that only every second model was directly reproducible. We use this classification to analyze if reproducible models in Systems Biology have a higher impact in terms of citation numbers. For the analysis, we use Bayesian Estimation, which provides complete distributional information for group means and standard deviations. Outliers are handled via a non-central t-distribution. Beginning about ten years after the introduction of SBML (2013), reproducibility gained broad awareness in the Systems Biology community. Since then, reproducible models have gotten significantly more citations than non-reproducible ones. Our analysis shows 95% credibility for higher citation rates of reproducible models for 2013-2020, and all investigated sub-periods after 2013 to 2020.
Further, normalization to the journal impact factor showed that journals of all ranks could profit by forcing reproducibility. In conclusion, reproducible models offer long-term benefits for journals and individual researchers in terms of more citations. The higher citation count provides evidence for increased reuse of these models and could promote progress in Systems Biology. (HÃ¶pfl et al.)
