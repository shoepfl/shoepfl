Bayesian Modeling of Time Series Data (BayModTS) \"<em>is a FAIR Bayesian modeling workflow of time series data.</em>\" BayModTS can classify outliers in heterogenous and sparse data cases, based on an uncertainty prediction of the dynamics of a system. Further, conditions can be distinguished based on the underyling uncertainty with a user-specified credibility level.
