I am a data scientist with focus on statistics and uncertainty quantification of biological systems. The holistic view of systems biology in a field as complex as biology is what fascinates me the most. From my point of view, the best way to get this knowledge is to take a deeper look at the data we generate. My contribution is a sound statistical analysis and modeling of heterogeneous data. To this end, I apply Bayesian Estimation (a Bayesian way of hypothesis testing) to various datasets and develope a FAIR Bayesian workflow for processing sparse and heterogeneous data (BayModTS).
